                                    Your money will be invested in stock market, fixed income, and money market. The

                                    world. In very short term, like less than one year, there are many factors including
                                    market phycology, manipulation, macro-economic factors etc. that affect the stock
                                    prices.

                                    However, in long term, stock prices tend to follow the fundamental factors of the
                                    company like profitability etc. There is a saying, in short term, stock market is a
                                    voting machine and in long term it is weighting machine.

                                    Bangladesh capital market is very small. Small amount of money can influence stock
                                    prices. But, if we look at mid to long term i.e. more than 5 years, we can
                                    confidently say that good companies with strong fundamentals with favorable buy
                                    price will provide best returns.

                                    The tricky part here is finding good companies and more challenging part is finding
                                    out reasonable prices to entry. There is a saying that astute businessmen make
                                    profits not by selling but at the time of buying.

                                    A fundâ€™s NAV goes up or down depending on change in market value of the assets held
                                    by the fund. Therefore, if the market value of the assets falls substantially, there
                                    is a chance of the NAV going below the face value of the fund. However, such events
                                    are expected to be temporary as NAV is projected to grow in the long term with
